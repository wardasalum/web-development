                What is C#?
            C# is pronounced "C-Sharp".
            
            It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.
            
            C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.
            
            The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 11, was released in November 2022.
            
            C# is used for:
            <ul>
                <li> mobile application</li>
                <li>desktop application</li>
                <li>website</li>
            </ul>

C# Get Started
C# IDE
The easiest way to get started with C#, is to use an IDE.

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit and compile code.

In our tutorial, we will use Visual Studio Community, which is free to download from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/.

Applications written in C# use the .NET Framework, so it makes sense to use Visual Studio, as the program, the framework, and the language, are all created by Microsoft</p>
